# Flask-E-commerce
This is a simple e-commerce website written with the python Flask framework. It allows the user to signup/login and shop. You can then go through a simple checkout workflow (without the payment processing step). The database for this is a written in Sqlite. This application is intended to be used as part of courses I have written that help  software testers learn how to use SQL in their work.  

It was originally forked off of this repo https://github.com/Himani13040/Flask-E-commerce
